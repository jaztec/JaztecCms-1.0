JaztecCms 1.0
=============

This website I've build in 2010 to test my knowledge of Zend Framework 1.

It's the application my personal website runs on. Administration happens directly through phpMyAdmin, I never really came to building a decent back-end for the CMS.

It's no longer actively used now bu maybe someone can use some parts of it now.
